I'm a research scientist in Meteorology. I'm interested in inverse problems in atmospheric physics, such as improving the initial conditions of numerical weather prediction using observations, numerical models, and data assimilation algorithms. 

In my PhD, I studied the assimilation of cloud-affected satellite visible and infrared observations to improve convective-scale numerical weather prediction (i.e. small-scale storms). 
My research has shown (1) that assimilating visible observations can improve storm forecasts to a baseline forecast;
(2) that assimilating visible in addition to infrared observations can give a synergistic benefit that is better than either visible or infrared experiments;
(3) that nonlinear observation operators lead to deviations of the posterior. The deviations were quantified and may pave the road for a potential nonlinearity correction scheme.
