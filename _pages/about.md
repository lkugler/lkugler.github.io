I'm a research scientist in Meteorology. My goal is to improve our understanding of the processes that drive the weather so that we can advance weather prediction. We do that by analyzing forecast errors using data assimilation methods, which allows us to improve our representation of physics or time-varying initial conditions.

I'm currently employed as a fixed-term postdoc for the [DEPENDABLE](https://www.fwf.ac.at/forschungsradar/10.55776/P37259) project at the University of Vienna.

In my PhD, I studied the assimilation of cloud-affected satellite visible and infrared observations to improve convective-scale numerical weather prediction (i.e. small-scale storms). 
My research has shown (1) that assimilating visible observations can improve storm forecasts to a baseline forecast;
(2) that assimilating visible in addition to infrared observations can give a synergistic benefit that is better than either visible or infrared experiments;
(3) that nonlinear observation operators lead to deviations of the posterior. The deviations were quantified and may pave the road for a potential nonlinearity correction scheme.
